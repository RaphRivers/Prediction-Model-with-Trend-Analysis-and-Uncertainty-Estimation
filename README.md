# Prediction Model with Trend Analysis and Uncertainty Estimation
This mini-project aims to demonstrate the process of building a prediction model that makes predictions, studies the trends of the output, expresses the uncertainty of that output, and expresses the uncertainty on individual measurements of a dataset. The project involves generating and using random numbers as training data to illustrate how such a model can be constructed and analyzed.

## Objectives
- Generate Random Numbers: We will create random numbers to serve as our input data.
- Define Relationships: Establish a linear relationship between the input and output data.
- Model Output Behavior: Visualize how the model's output behaves and changes with different inputs.
- Estimate Uncertainty: Express the uncertainty of the model's predictions and the uncertainty of individual measurements in the dataset.

## Methodology
### Linear Model Formulation
I will use a simple linear model to represent the relationship between random input (𝑥) and output (𝑦). The linear model is given by the equation:

$$\mu = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times x $$

Here, 𝜇 is the predicted output, 𝛽0 is the intercept, and 𝛽1 is the slope of the line.

### Steps
1. **Specify True Coefficients:** Define the true values of the intercept (𝛽0) and slope (𝛽1) of the linear model.
2. **Calculate Trend:** For a given input value, calculate the trend or average output using the linear model.
3. **Generate Output Observations:** Use a Gaussian random number generator to create output observations around the calculated trend, simulating real-world data with noise.
4. **Fit the Model:** Use the generated data to fit a two-variable linear model, estimating the coefficients 𝛽0 and 𝛽1
5. **Analyze Trends:** Study the trends of the output data and visualize the fitted model.
6. **Express Uncertainty:** Quantify and express the uncertainty in the model's predictions and individual measurements.

By following these steps, we can build a simple prediction model using linear regression, analyze the trends in the output, and express the uncertainty in the model's predictions and individual measurements. This project serves as a foundation for understanding more complex prediction models and uncertainty quantification techniques.
